# Hello, I'm Ian Villarreal, welcome to my landing page!

## About Me
I am a Junior at The University of Texas at San Antonio with a strong interest in blue team cybersecurity, digital forensics, and incident response. This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences - going beyond what can fit my resume. It is actively updated with more projects and HackTheBox writeups, and soon, competition writeups (excluding certain CTFs where organizers requested write-ups not be published). I plan to maintain this repository throughout college and my professional career as I continue to learn and grow in the cybersecurity field.

## Objective

My journey in computer science and my passion for technology has fueled my passion for cybersecurity. I am particularly focused on developing the necessary skills to become a Security Analyst, with the long-term goal of advancing into Incident Response. To support this path, I have developed projects and HackTheBox write-ups that strengthen the core defensive and analytical skills required for my journey. I also plan to branch outside my immediate role to increase my skill set and broaden my capabilities. This portfolio reflects my growth and commitment to continuous learning in the cybersecurity industry.
